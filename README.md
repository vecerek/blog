# blog

This monorepo contains all the code examples I publish in my blog posts at https://dev.to/attila_vecerek.
The repo helps make sure that all published code examples can be compiled and executed.

Each workspace represents a single series of blog posts.
Each folder under the workspace represents a single post.
Each file under the folder represents a single code block.
The files are named so that the order represents the actual order in which the code blocks are written in the posts.
